# Rules

## Team Management

### Tanking

Tanking tactics are frowned upon.Teams need have a Goals For:Goals Against ratio of at least 1:2. Going below 1:2 will lead to your draft pick getting bumped down to 14th in the draft. If you do not own your 1st in that draft, you get a warning. We will use even lottery odds to further prevent this.

### Rosters and Tactics

- Overload is NOT allowed
- Minimum of 30 players, of which at least 3 are goalies, signed at all times excluding July and August.
- 20 players dressed and assigned to standard lines. 18 skaters and 2 goalies. Skaters must be in a configuration of 12 forwards 6 defenders.
- Defender and forward usage must both be set to either equal or normal.
- Coach games yourself must be turned off from GM settings.

### Salary Cap

You are responsible for potential AGM moves made due to going over in-game cap. Be careful about potential returns from injuries and players joining the team from free agency. 

In case of rogue AGM waives you may provide an alternative player to get waived/sent down to fix the cap or roster player limit.

## Trading

### Basic Trading Rules

- All trades must be posted in #trade-announcements with explanations. 
- React with V to veto. 5 votes triggers a veto.
- No AI trading.

### Trade Conditions

Only possible conditions are draft picks, no player conditions are allowed. Possible conditions in trade deals can be tied to:
- **Results:** For example winning the Stanley Cup or making the 2nd round of playoffs. The conditional picks need to be of future seasons.
> *Example: “If DAL makes it to the 2nd Round, ARI receives DAL 2nd instead of their 4th”*
- **Players re-signing:** The conditional picks need to be of future seasons and the player needs to be an expiring UFA. 
> *Example: “If Holtby re-signs with COL before July 1st, WSH receives COL 1st 21 and COL 1st 22”*
- **Lottery protection:** If a 1st rounder is traded, it can be lottery protected. The conditional picks must be specified when announcing the trade, together with the condition. Example: “if FLA 1st 2020 is in the top 10, PIT gets FLA 1st 2021 and FLA 5th 2020 instead.”
- **Statistical conditions ARE allowed.**
> *Example: the James Neal/Milan Lucic trade IRL or “If Player X plays X numbers of games”*

### Trade Restrictions

- Players will not be eligible to be traded back to a team that formerly possessed them until one calendar year in-game passes. 
- Any Free Agents signed may not be traded until January 1st of the next year.
- First round draft picks may only be traded for the current season and the season after. For example during TDL of 2020, you may only trade 1st round picks of the 2020 and 2021 drafts. Picks become available for trading in July. This applies to conditional deals as well.

### Trade Vetoes

- If a trade receives 5 V’s, the trade will be forwarded to the veto committee that consists of 7 active GMs. Any trade sent to the committee will be reviewed and a vote will be held.
- Veto a trade by reacting a :regional_indicator_v: to it in #trade-announcements.
- Vetoes must be within 24 hours of the trade post.
- You must provide a brief explanation of the veto to a commish.

## Draft

### Draft Lottery

- The draft lottery will be held after the regular season and all non-playoffs teams will be given even odds.
- Lottery order is decided through a completely random simulation on 100yardrush.com. It will be live streamed through discord to show transparency. (Replay will be available)

### Draft Format
- The draft will be held through discord with the following set up:
> **1st Round Picks 1-15:** 3h
> 
> **1st Round Picks 16-31:** 1h
> 
> **2nd Round:** 1h
> 
> **3rd Round:** 1h
> 
> **4th Round:** 15m
> 
> **5th Round:** 15m
> 
> **6th Round:** 15m
> 
> **7th Round:** 15m
- Lists are encouraged with this set up, so try your best to send one in. BPAs suck.
- Live drafts will occur in case the playoffs have ended before the draft is finished and it is deemed necessary to move on.
- For rounds 2-7, your draft timer STARTS when you are tagged in the discord draft channel. 

## Free Agency

### Tryouts
- You are not allowed to send out tryout offers to UFAs or unsigned RFAs. 
It resets contract demands and potentially blocks actual signings of the players. Tryouts to RFAs can reset their arbitration filings, hence not allowed.

### RFA procedure
- When an offer sheet is accepted, you must post the contract details in #offersheets channel and tag the GM who owns the players rights. They then have 36 hours to respond.

### Offer sheet rules
- To offersheet a player you MUST have the picks available needed in case the offersheet is accepted and not matched. 
- You may NOT offersheet a player in case the picks needed for compensation are further than 2 seasons away without coming to a commish first.
- You cannot offersheet more than one player requiring the same pick compensation simultaneously.
- For the maximum offersheet (4x1st compensation) you MUST have your next 2 1sts AND 2 other 1sts in those drafts at your disposal to offer the sheet.
- In case your offersheet gets accepted without the proper compensation available, you will have to delete your GM to cancel the transfer. If it’s too late, you will be responsible for the full buyout.

**Breaking any of these rules will lead to following penalties:**
- **1st Offense:** Warning + Any Cap Penalties from releasing the player to FA
- **2nd Offense:** Closest 2nd Round Pick available to aggrieved team 
- **3rd Offense:** Removal from the league

## Miscellaneous Rules

### AHL Loaning

A GM will not be permitted to loan a player to another team’s AHL team without first  seeking and acquiring permission.  

### Preseason games

Preseason Games should be organized with other teams GM being aware.  Turn on “Board arranging games” in your GM options if you wish to have them automatically arranged.

### Mulligans and Protections

Will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the commish team. You will be publicly shamed, and we will not keep protecting your players if you are just straight up incompetent.
